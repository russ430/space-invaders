# Space Invaders

In order to sharpen my JavaScript skills I wanted to challenge myself to build an application without any libraries or frameworks. I landed on developing a game and decided to recreate the classic computer game Space Invaders. I built the game to have 5 levels that increase in difficulty as each level is passed. The player will have 3 lives per level and scores points for each invader eliminated.

## Usage
Feel free to clone the repository if you'd like, follow the steps below to get it up and running on your machine.

### Installation

After downloading or cloning the repository head to the root directory of the project and install the dependencies.

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Serve
Once dependencies are installed you can start up a development server to view any changes you make as you make them and watch the game come to life.

```sh
$ npm run start
```

### Build
If you'd like to build out the JavaScript bundle once you're finished editing go ahead and run the npm command below and a 'build' folder will be created after bundling is finished.

```sh
$ npm run build
```
